More parameters:
  * Number of iterations where the sequence stay inside and number of iterations where the sequence must have escaped
  * Range of escape

Make the number of iterations and complex numbers changeable parameters

Save last changeable parameters and offer to reuse them the next time the program is launched

Add the compression system for the disk file and the ram file

Let the user choose between 'full sequence save' or '(compressed or not) image' (or make an algorithm to take the faster method / the method that uses the less ra√π space) for the way each cpu stores the sequence

Alert the user when parameters take too much ram

Display when choosing the parameters what will be the ram consumption
